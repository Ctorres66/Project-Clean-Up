# Project-Clean-Up
Made as part of ML Devs for Puerto Rico. In this project, all members attempted to create a visual recognition AI to detect different pieces of trash in beach images. This version is specifically focused on identifying bottlecaps. We created the images by taking various images of a scene we created in Unity. Becuase of issues with Unity and the github for Unity asset, i am currently unable to push the scene itself into this respository. However, the final result and the images used to achieve it can be seen here:  https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/studio/watson-vision-combined/d91e1183-ea56-4e62-9ea8-25bc995a4f72/view/objects?context=cpdaas&amp;project_id=80c3ed49-6654-4762-8b7d-6cb482a3cd3c&amp;training_definition_id=2b237568-01e9-4cb4-bb33-d6b06d480bc8&amp;context=cpdaas
